🏠 RealLiquid: My Dive Into RWA Finance

It was while I was wasting years of my day light with administration, bank clerks, customs, loan companies, bs investment vehicles, scaling business in the USA, that I realised, had blockchain been involved, some of these contracts can be smart contracts and some of these smart contracts can unlock horizontal scalability for entire networks of partners. 
It made me want to discover how money actually works and to research into how current applications and rising markets could benefit from blockchain. 
I decided to look into the connection between real estate and influencers and loans and that's how the concept of RealLiquid was born.

This repo was inspired by the training by Liquid Network & Blockstream in May, Plovdiv, Bulgaria 2025. 

Why this project?
To explore how blockchains, DeFi, and tokenization might offer better personal and business finance strategies and real-world utility — so I can build systems that help others avoid the same costly missteps I made.

RealLiquid
A federated Liquid Network platform for tokenizing real estate assets
🔐 Confidential transfers
⚡ BTC-based settlement
💸 Instant investor payouts

🔑 Core Concept
A federation of partners (e.g., Bitfinex, Bull Bitcoin) issues and manages tokenized real estate assets on the Liquid Network:
- L-REITs (Liquid Real Estate Investment Trusts)
- L-CONDOS (Fractional condo ownership tokens)
- L-BLDG (Full building asset tokens)
- L-BTC (Liquid BTC for rent/gain payouts)
- L-INFLUENCER (Liquid Influencer Pay Out with Loan Rights Turning Influencers into Businesses who Support Other Horizontal Businesses to Be Established)
All transfers are confidential, with 1-minute finality and seamless peg-in/peg-out with Bitcoin.

🚀 Features
🏠 Asset Issuance:
issue_asset("L-REIT", supply, peg_btc=True)

🔐 Confidential Transfers:
transfer_confidential(asset_id, recipient_pubkey)

⚡ Atomic Swaps:
swap_atomic(asset_1, asset_2)

🪙 Federated Reserve Management:
Multi-signature treasury control.

🧾 Stable Income Streams:
Rents and profits paid in L-BTC, instantly swappable for BTC.

🧪 Use Case
A Canadian developer tokenizes a real estate portfolio into L-CONDOS.
Investors peg-in BTC and receive tokens.
Monthly rent is paid out in L-BTC — which can be swapped or pegged out back to BTC in minutes.

🔄 Add-ons
Hodl Hodl Lending:
Use L-BTC as collateral for mortgage-backed lending

SideSwap Integration:
