In Liquid, we have a wallet, that can hold address pubkeys. 
Our wallet address: 070fba86ba269142317acd26981adfc78d2de01c45f6fff773f5d8a768edb339 is the block hash of our address creation. 

bcrt1qcrpjfjyu5fx4qzd8zcc7mj3mum2zvak50287pm is the wallet address, it was created for the  purpose of receiving tokens from the faucet. It is a SegWit address (P2SH) (not a Native SegWit address, not bech32).

033ac54265877391692bb41152cdcd224bae16afd5f2b4536db2065e9d2a86a06a is the pubkey. This is what we save in our .env file (for the purpose of the prototype), in order to interact and sign the settlement oracle, the coordination call, and the transfer.

7022a48d/84'/1'/0'
7022a48d = your wallet fingerprint derived from the masterkey
84'/1'/0' =  BIP84 path
84' Native SegWit (BIP84) 
1' Testnet (mainnet is 0')
0' Account 0
The stuff after tpub including tpub is the XPUB = testnet extended public key
/0/* This path generates receiving addresses (/1/* would be change addresses)
The tpub can be used for watch only, we can import the address into other wallets to track balances or generate receiving addresses without access to private keys.
